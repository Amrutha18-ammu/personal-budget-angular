               <p>A budget is a spending plan based on income and expenses. 
                  In other words, it's an estimate of how much money you'll make and spend over a certain period of time, such as a month or year.</p>

                  The rule states that you should spend up to 50% of your after-tax income on needs and obligations that you must-have or must-do. 
                  The remaining half should be split up between 20% savings and debt repayment and 30% to everything else that you might want.</p>

                  Budget outcomes refer to the balance on the budget  surplus, balanced or deficit. 
                  A surplus budget occurs when there is greater tax revenue than government spending (T>G). 
                  A balanced budget occurs when tax revenue is equal to government spending (T=G).</p>
